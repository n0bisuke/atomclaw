# License Notes

This repository is distributed under the MIT License (`LICENSE`).

## Fork Context

- This project is a fork/evolution of MimiClaw.
- Major AtomClaw-specific modifications were added in this repository.

## MIT Compliance Checklist

When redistributing source or binaries:

1. Keep the MIT license text.
2. Keep copyright notices.
3. Keep attribution for upstream-derived portions where applicable.

## Third-Party / Service Notes

- API services (Discord, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cloudflare, Brave Search) have their own Terms of Service.
- This repository license does not replace those service terms.
- If you add third-party assets (images/fonts/models), ensure their licenses are compatible and documented.

## Maintainer Recommendation

- For releases, include `LICENSE` in source/binary distributions.
- If substantial new external code is imported, add a dedicated notice file for that dependency.
